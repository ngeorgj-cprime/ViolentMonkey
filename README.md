# Violent Monkey Scripts

Those will Extend Functionality on Jira (Cloud/Server).

To use the scripts, download the Violent Monkey extension for your browser (chrome/firefox), create a new script, copy the desired script and paste it in your ViolentMonkey script page and save it. When you load the pages with the url matching, the functionality will be there. Feel free to edit the scripts as you wish.

This is a growing repo, new code will be added here whenever the functionality is created.
